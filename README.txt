Name: AnmolLibrarySystem (c) 2018

Version: 1.0.0

Description: There is a Database.txt file that contains all of the books stored in the library. In addition, there is also a Logfile.txt which documents all out-goings of books.

->Start the program by double-clicking the menu.py file. 

->A window will pop-up which will be the Graphical User Interface (GUI).

->There will be buttons that are interactive and will open a new window which will be in the command prompt.

->Follow the instructions on each file.

->This will allow you to complete another action.

I am proud of what I have made because I have started this course with little knowledge in programming. During the summer, I first introduced myself to basic concepts of Python programming. To be able to open a GUI window for the menu was incredibly rewarding. 

AnmolLibrarySystem works on a date basis so each book has a date stored for the last time it was removed from the library. 

A book needs to be added to the logfile atleast 10 times in order for the system to not suggest it through the weeding process. This is so the books that are in high demand are not removed. This weeding system is solely dependent on singular books and will not recommend a set of books unless they have not been removed atleast 10 times. The reason I did this is because there might be some demand for a certain book but not enough demand for all copies of the book to be removed. 

----DISCLAIMER----
The GUI window will not work until the window that has been opened from the button has been closed.
