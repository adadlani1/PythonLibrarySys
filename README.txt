Name: AnmolLibrarySystem (c) 2018

Version: 1.0.0

Description: There is a Database.txt file that contains all of the books stored in the library. In addition, there is also a Logfile.txt which documents all out-goings of books.

->Start the program by double-clicking the menu.py file. 

->A window will pop-up which will be the Graphical User Interface (GUI).

->There will be buttons that are interactive and will run on the IDLE interface.

->Follow the instructions on each file.

->This will allow you to complete another action.

I am proud of what I have made because I have started this course with little knowledge in programming. During the summer, I first introduced myself to basic concepts of Python programming. To be able to open a GUI window for the menu was incredibly rewarding. 

AnmolLibrarySystem works on a date basis so each book has a date stored for the last time it was removed from the library. 

A book needs to be added to the logfile atleast 10 times in order for the system to not suggest it through the weeding process. This is so the books that are in high demand are not removed. If the book has been removed atleast once, the program will ask the user if it needs the book removing. Depending on the answer, it will remove it (the book has to be in the library otherwise it cannot be weeded out. However, if the book has not been checked out at all, the system will automatically remove it as there is clearly no demand for the book.

This weeding system is solely dependent on singular books and will not recommend a set of books unless they have not been removed atleast 10 times. The reason I did this is because there might be some demand for a certain book but not enough demand for all copies of the book to be removed. 

----DISCLAIMER----
The system when searching for a book is case sensitive so the user needs to enter name of the book accurately.
