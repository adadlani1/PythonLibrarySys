# PythonLibrarySys


Name: AnmolLibrarySystem (c) 2018

Version: 1.0.0

Description: There is a Database.txt file that contains all of the books stored in the library. 
->Start the program by double-clicking the menu.py file. 

->A window will pop-up containing a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

->There will be buttons that are interactive and will open a new window.

->Follow the instructions on each file.

->Once you have completed your objective, you can close the window and go back to the GUI window.

->This will allow you to complete another action.

AnmolLibrarySystem works on a date basis so each book has a date stored for the last time it was removed from the library. If the book is in the library for more than 365 consecutive days, the book will appear in the weeding section and will advise the librarian to remove it in order to make space for newer books.

----DISCLAIMER----
The GUI window will not work until the window that has been opened from the button has been closed.
